# MoMath Hackathon 2018: Spirographs of Venus

**Project Category**: Math Square
**Team**: [LINK][5]

---

### The Math and the Submission

* *Spirographs of Venus* is based off of the idea of Rennaisance-era discovery of **The Pentagram of Venus**

* Charting the distance between Earth and Venus for 8 Years (13 Venus years) creates a floral design.

* My exhibit for the Math Square floor replicates the mathematical beauty of orbiting bodies, allowing the players to step and create orbits that plot the distances between planets as they orbit the sun.

### Additional Notes

* When a player steps on the exhibit, it will create a planet under where they step. 

* Lines are drawn periodically between a line that was created and the subsequent line.

  * Additionally, line color is determined by blending together the colors of the connected planets.

* The oldest patterns fade away for a variety of reason:

  * Reduce clutter on the board (if many people are providing input)

  * Eventually clear the board (to reset for incoming people)

### Gallery

* These are just a few examples of the wide variety of possible designs that can be made
