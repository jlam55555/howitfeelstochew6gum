# MoMath Hackathon 2018: Spirographs of Venus

**Project Category**: Math Square
**Team**: [LINK][5]

### The Math

* *Spirographs of Venus* is based off of the idea of Rennaisance-era discovery of **The Pentagram of Venus**

The floral design of the pentagram was discovered by periodically plotting the distance between the Earth and Venus over 8 years. Due to the fact that 8 Earth years are the same length as 13.004 Venus years, a beautiful floral design is created ([source][6]).

### The Submission

* This exhibit for the Math Square floor replicates the mathematical beauty of orbiting bodies, allowing the players to step and create planets. The distances between subsequent planets are plotted, producing a design similar to that of The Pentagram of Venus, yet diverse in color, size, and design.
---

### Additional Notes

* When a player steps on the exhibit, it will create a planet under where they step. 

* Lines are drawn periodically between a planet that was created and the subsequent planet.

  * Additionally, line color is determined by blending together the colors of the connected planets.

* The oldest patterns fade away for a variety of reason:

  * Reduce clutter on the board (if many people are providing input)

  * Eventually clear the board (to reset for incoming people)

### Gallery

* These are just a few examples of the wide variety of possible designs that can be made with this exhibit.
