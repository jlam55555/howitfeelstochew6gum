### The Submission
Last year we had a lot of fun playing with the [harmonic sequence in trigonometric functions][1]; we found a novel way to implement it again this year! Knowing that length affects period of a pendulum, we created a animation of multiple pendulums.

### The Math
For small angles (thirty degrees is stretching it) the period is proportional to the square root of length, where length is the distance from the axis of rotation. This is included in our calculation of the position of the pendulums. We did not use physical equations to demostrate the motion, but approximated it with a simple sine function representing its harmonic motion. The important part in demostrating the harmonics is the relationship between period and length, which is preserved in our calculations.
