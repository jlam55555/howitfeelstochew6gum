### Submission
In NYC, sirens are always wailing past you: EEEEOOOOOEEEEEOOOOOEeeeooooeeeeeoooeeooeo&hellip; The loud, annoying, high-pitched sound to the fading, lower noise.

This exhibit attempts to demonstrate what happens to the frequency and wavelength of an oscillating particle in motion, such as the sound of moving sirens &mdash; the Doppler effect. In this exhibit, the particle moves along a particular track and is always sending off waves travelling at a constant velocity. As the particle moves, the waves in front of the particle are condensed, and the waves behind it are elongated. When not moving, the Doppler effect is not present and the waves are symmetric.

In this exhibit, the particle's representation is indicated by the slat that is sticking out on the top. The waves it generates are shown along the bottom edge of the slates. The waves propagate away from the particle's position at a constant rate.

This exhibit is not targeted for any specific age group, as it can teach little children about the Doppler effect or illustrate the phenomenon to people who already know it.

### Math and Real-world Applications
The Doppler effect is explored in the high school physics curriculum in the study of waves. Equations of waves can be used to solve for differences in frequency or the velocity of the source.

![v=f/lambda][2]

![f'=(v\_src+v)/vf][3]

These equations can be used from trivial matters like finding the speed of an incoming firetruck to huge projects like using [red and blue shift][4] to try to find the speed of the expansion of the universe.

### Additional Notes / Specs
- Period: 40\pi seconds
- Schedule of particle's lateral movement (length: 4 periods; loops after finishing):

    | Time (periods) | Description | Purpose |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 0-2 | Slow oscillation back and forth between slats 14 and 114 | Show how the Doppler effect piles up waves in front of it |
    | 2-2.5 | Stay in the center | Show the Doppler effect doesn't apply to non-moving particles |
    | 2.5-2.75 | Move to one end | |
    | 2.75-3.25 | Accelerate from 0 velocity to close to the wave's propagation speed. | Show a slightly more extreme version of the Doppler effect as the particle approaches the wave propagation speed. |
    | 3.25-3.5 | Move back to the center. | |
    | 3.5-4 | Stay in the center. | |
- The edges of the exhibit are considered "open"&mdash; the waves do not reflect back from the edges.
