### The Math and the Submission

* *Polygons of Venus* is based off of the idea of Rennaisance-era discovery of **The Pentagram of Venus**

* Charting the distance between Earth and Venus for 8 Years (13 Venus years) creates a beautiful floral design.

* My program for the Math Square floor replicates this same mathematical beauty, allowing the players to step and create orbits that plot the distances between planets as they orbit the sun.
